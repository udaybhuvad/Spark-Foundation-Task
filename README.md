# Spark-Foundation-Task
Contains the tasks given by The Sparks Foundation under GRIP(Graduate Rotational Internship Program ) December 2020.

#Task 1- Prediction using Supervised ML

Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data; What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day?

#Task 2- Prediction using Unsupervised ML

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually. Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

#Task 3- Exploratory Data Analysis(Retail)

Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’ As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make more profit. What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data? Dataset: https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl

#Task 4- Exploratory Data Analysis (Terrorism)

Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’ As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism. What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA? Dataset: https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5

#Task 6- Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm

Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right class accordingly. Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox
